# 🧠 R Learning Projects

This repository contains a series of beginner-to-intermediate level R projects focused on building practical skills in data analysis, visualization, modeling, and dashboard development. Perfect for anyone starting out with R and looking to apply it to real-world tasks.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

### 1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration**
- Load and inspect a raw dataset (`read.csv`, `str`, `summary`)
- Handle missing values and rename columns
- Use `dplyr` for filtering, grouping, and summarizing
- Explore distributions and relationships

💡 *Suggested dataset:* Titanic or `gapminder`

---

### 2. **Data Visualization with ggplot2**
- Create scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, and boxplots
- Customize plot aesthetics (labels, colors, themes)
- Use `facet_wrap` to split plots by category
- Add trend lines or regression overlays

💡 *Goal:* Tell a visual story with your data

---

### 3. **Linear Regression Modeling**
- Build a linear model with `lm()`
- Interpret coefficients, R², and p-values
- Check assumptions (residuals, multicollinearity)
- Visualize model fit with `ggplot2`

💡 *Example:* Predict car prices or house prices from features

---

### 4. **Interactive Dashboard with Shiny**
- Build a minimal `shiny` web app
- Include user inputs (dropdowns, sliders)
- Display filtered data and plots
- Bonus: Add reactive summaries or download options

💡 *Idea:* Track COVID-19 cases or visualize Gapminder trends by continent/year
